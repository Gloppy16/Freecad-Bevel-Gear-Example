# Freecad-Bevel-Gear-Example
An example sketch for bevel gears in freecad. All values can be changed in the spreadsheet. The sketch in the body GearsetValues can help understand how all the values fit togther.

The gears currently do not mesh properly.

You'll also need the freecad.gears workbench to adjust the gears.
